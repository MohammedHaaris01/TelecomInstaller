## üõ†Ô∏è Installation Guide

### Step 1: Clone the repository

Open your terminal and clone the installer repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MohammedHaaris01/TelecomInstaller.git ~/srsRAN-installer
cd ~/srsRAN-installer
```

### Step 2: Make all scripts executable
Ensure all scripts have the necessary execution permissions:
```bash
chmod +x *.sh
```

### Important: The Scripts should be run strictly in the following order

### Step 3: Run the scripts
Run each module separately in the following order:
```bash
sudo ./dependencies.sh
sudo ./open5gs.sh
sudo ./srsGUI.sh
sudo ./srsRAN_4G.sh
sudo ./srsRAN_Project.sh
```
### Step 4: Verify srsRAN and srsGUI
Check that the binaries were installed successfully and are available in your system's path:
```bash
srsenb --version
```

### üí° Notes
* All scripts will clone repositories into the user‚Äôs home directory (~), even when run with sudo, to prevent future permission conflicts during development.

* If a repository already exists in the target location, the script will skip cloning and proceed directly to the build step.

* Each major step logs its output to a dedicated .log file for easy troubleshooting.
